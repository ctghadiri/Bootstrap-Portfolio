### Learning Points
* Bootstrap is an amzing tool but limited in its own ways with styling and sizes in certain aspects
* The grid system was a major player in the homework because of its responsive nature
* Planning is huge when using bootstrap
    - Knowing how many columns and rows you want to use 
    - What type of content and components you want to use etc.
